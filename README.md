# hello-world
first project

Hey Y'all!

I just started this journey to learn programming last week, (the week of 16 Aug 2020)
I am excited to pursue this project
I love the aha moments that have happened so far
As an athlete, it is very similar to stopping a big play, or smacking someone as they run down the sideline.
